# Static_Node.js_and_Express_Site

This portfolio site was designed to showcase the recent projects I've built. Pug was used to provide templates that utilize 
a JSON file to generate the markup that is displayed in the browser. This back end project was developed with Node.js, 
Express and server-side JavaScript for setting up server, importing required dependencies, utilizing static files, 
handling requests and errors.

List of customized style:
1. background color of the side bar.
2. add a new font - 'EB Garamond'.
3. add favicon.
